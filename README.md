Statically examine a Java class for suspicious features.  For example, find attempts to do I/O, dynamic class loading, start threads, etc.  The intended application is programming exercise judges, where the system will be executing untrusted code.  Credit: Nick Parlante mentioned that [CodingBat](http://codingbat.com) does this, so I am stealing the idea for [CloudCoder](http://cloudcoder.org).

I am just starting to work on this, so it doesn't do anything useful yet.
